- Promise vs. Past Behavior View: Juxtapose candidate campaign promises with their historical actions to highlight alignment or contrast, without subjective interpretation.
- Candidate Comparison: Enable side-by-side comparison of candidates across experience, positions, policy focus, and track record history, presented neutrally without scoring or ranking.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A desaturated blue (#6699CC) to evoke trust, stability, and neutrality, reflecting the non-partisan mission.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white, for a clean and accessible reading experience in a light scheme.
- Accent color: A muted violet (#9966CC) for interactive elements and highlights, providing contrast while maintaining neutrality.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for modern look, with readability.
- Use simple, consistent icons to represent data categories (e.g., education, experience, policy areas). Icons should be monochrome and neutral in style.
- Employ a clean, modular layout with ample whitespace to ensure readability and focus. Content should be structured for easy scanning and backtracking of information.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting. Avoid flashy or opinionated animations.
